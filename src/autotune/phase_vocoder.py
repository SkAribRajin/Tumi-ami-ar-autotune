Phase Vocoder Pitch Shifting
==============================
See project chat history / report for full worked-example explanations of
each piece. Summary:
  1. compute_stft - magnitude + phase per frame
  2. compute_instantaneous_frequency - precise per-bin frequency via phase tracking
  3. find_peaks / assign_regions - locate spectral peaks (harmonics) and figure
     out which bins "belong" to which peak (needed for phase locking, step 5)
  4. remap_and_lock_spectrum - moves each peak's energy to the bin near its
     shifted frequency, and drags its neighboring bins along with it, all
     phase-locked to the peak so they don't drift apart from each other
  5. phase_vocoder_shift - ties it all together (the CONTRACTS.md function)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why this version differs from a naive "keep magnitude in the same bin, just
push the phase" approach (the bug we found and fixed):

Each FFT bin behaves like a narrow bandpass filter centered on that bin's own
frequency (bandwidth roughly +/- sample_rate/frame_size). If you leave a
harmonic's magnitude sitting in its original bin but tell its phase to evolve
as if it were now a much higher/lower frequency, you're asking that narrow
filter to output energy far outside the range it's physically capable of
producing - the phase trick can't overcome that. That's why big shift ratios
(1.5x, 2x) didn't just sound bad, they collapsed toward the wrong pitch
entirely.

The fix has two parts:
  (a) Actually move each harmonic's energy to a bin near its NEW (shifted)
      frequency, instead of leaving it in place. This is the frequency-domain
      equivalent of "resample the spectrum" - same physical effect as
      resampling the waveform, but done per-bin so it still fits the
      existing fixed-hop frame-in/frame-out contract instead of needing a
      separate whole-signal time-stretch+resample pass.
  (b) Phase-lock the bins around each harmonic peak together (rather than
      letting every bin accumulate its own independent phase trajectory).
      Small per-bin frequency-estimate errors used to accumulate over many
      frames and pull neighboring bins out of sync with each other - that's
      what caused the smearing/interference even at moderate ratios like
      1.05. Locking them to their peak means only one phase accumulator per
      harmonic can drift, not one per bin.

Formant Preservation
=======================
Problem: when the phase vocoder shifts pitch, it also drags your voice's
natural resonances (formants) along with it - a large shift makes you sound
like you inhaled helium ("chipmunk effect"), because the ENTIRE spectral
shape moved, not just the pitch.

The fix separates two things that are tangled together in a voice signal:
  - PITCH: which note is being sung (fast-changing, the harmonic "comb")
  - FORMANTS: what your voice naturally sounds like (slow-changing, the
    overall spectral SHAPE/envelope that harmonics sit inside)

We want to shift pitch but keep formants fixed. The technique below
("cepstral smoothing") separates them using the same FFT tools you already
trust:

    take the log of the magnitude spectrum
    -> inverse FFT it (this gives something called a "cepstrum")
    -> keep only the first ~30 values, zero out the rest
    -> FFT back

This works because in this transformed domain, the SLOW-changing formant
shape lives in the first few coefficients, and the FAST-changing pitch
harmonic detail lives in the later ones - so keeping only the first ~30
acts like a low-pass filter that isolates just the formant shape.

# Piece 1: Converting frames to frequency-domain (magnitude + phase)

Phase Vocoder Pitch Shifting — Overview
=========================================

Recall from pitch_detection.py: np.fft.rfft(frame) gives us a COMPLEX array,
one complex number per frequency bin. Each complex number encodes TWO things:

    magnitude = np.abs(X[k])        -> "how much" of this frequency is present
    phase     = np.angle(X[k])      -> "what point in its cycle" this frequency
                                        was at, at the start of this frame

For pitch detection, we only used magnitude (via the power spectrum). But to
properly SHIFT pitch without destroying the sound, we need both. Here's why:

If we simply move energy from bin k to bin k*ratio (to shift pitch), but
reconstruct each frame's phase independently (e.g., starting from 0 every
time), the frames won't line up smoothly when we overlap-add them back
together. Consecutive frames need their phases to evolve smoothly and
consistently, or you get a robotic/buzzy "phasiness" artifact.

So step 1 (this piece): extract magnitude AND phase from every frame,
so we have the full picture to work with before we touch anything.

Piece 2: Instantaneous Frequency via Phase Difference
========================================================

Why we need this: bin frequencies are coarse (locked to frame_size/sample_rate
spacing, ~21.5 Hz apart at our settings). Real voice pitch can be anywhere,
not just at these exact bin centers. By comparing how much the phase actually
advanced between two consecutive frames vs. how much we'd EXPECT it to
advance if the signal were sitting exactly at the bin's center frequency,
we can figure out the TRUE frequency much more precisely.

Worked numeric example (frame_size=2048, hop_size=512, sample_rate=44100):
    bin k=20 center frequency = 20 * 44100/2048 = 430.7 Hz
    expected phase advance per hop for this bin:
        = 2*pi * k * hop_size / frame_size
        = 2*pi * 20 * 512/2048
        = 2*pi * 5.0
        = 31.416 radians

    Suppose the ACTUAL signal is exactly 440 Hz (slightly higher than the
    bin's 430.7 Hz center). Its true phase advance per hop would be:
        = 2*pi * 440 * (512/44100)
        = 2*pi * 5.1043
        = 32.076 radians

    deviation = actual - expected = 32.076 - 31.416 = 0.660 radians per hop
    extra frequency = deviation / (2*pi) * (sample_rate/hop_size)
                     = 0.660 / (2*pi) * (44100/512)
                     = 0.105 * 86.13
                     = 9.04 Hz

    true frequency estimate = bin center + extra = 430.7 + 9.04 = 439.7 Hz
    -> much closer to the real 440 Hz than the coarse 430.7 Hz bin estimate!

The phase-wrapping problem: np.angle() always returns values in [-pi, pi].
Our raw phase difference (actual - expected) might genuinely be, say, 7.5
radians, but np.angle()-based subtraction will show something like
7.5 - 2*pi = 1.2 instead. We MUST correct for this by wrapping the deviation
back into [-pi, pi] ourselves before converting it to a frequency - otherwise
our "extra frequency" calculation above would be wildly wrong.

"""
Piece 3: Shifting Frequency and Re-Synthesizing Phase
=========================================================

Now that we know the TRUE frequency in each bin (from Piece 2), shifting
pitch is conceptually simple: multiply every bin's true frequency by our
shift_ratio. E.g., if shift_ratio=1.05, a bin whose true content was 440 Hz
now represents content at 462 Hz.

But we can't just "put" this shifted frequency into a fresh phase from
scratch each frame - remember, that causes robotic artifacts. Instead we
must ACCUMULATE phase smoothly across frames, using the shifted frequency.

Think of a phase accumulator as a runner going around a track:
    new_phase = previous_synthesized_phase + (shifted_frequency's expected
                phase advance for this hop)

This is exactly like: position = previous_position + speed * time
Except here "speed" is angular frequency and "time" is hop_size/sample_rate.

Worked example:
    true frequency = 440 Hz, shift_ratio = 1.05
    shifted frequency = 440 * 1.05 = 462 Hz

    phase advance per hop for 462 Hz:
        = 2*pi * 462 * (hop_size/sample_rate)
        = 2*pi * 462 * (512/44100)
        = 2*pi * 5.363
        = 33.70 radians

    if previous synthesized phase (for this bin) was, say, 1.0 radian:
        new synthesized phase = 1.0 + 33.70 = 34.70 radians
    (we do NOT wrap this - phase accumulates continuously across the
    whole signal, we only wrap when actually reading with np.sin/cos
    which handles huge angles fine automatically)

it back into a real time-domain frame - exactly the reverse of np.fft.rfft()
we used in Piece 1.

Piece 5: The Full Phase Vocoder Pipeline
===========================================

This ties Pieces 1-4 together into one function matching the signature
agreed in CONTRACTS.md:

    phase_vocoder_shift(frames, shift_ratios, config) -> shifted_frames

Workflow per frame:
    1. Convert all frames to magnitude + phase        (Piece 1)
    2. Get precise true frequency per bin, per frame   (Piece 2)
    3. Shift frequencies + accumulate new phase        (Piece 3)
    4. Rebuild each frame from magnitude + new phase   (Piece 4)
